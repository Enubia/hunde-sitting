Api:
    Database:
        Revisit db tables:
            ☐ check core tables for missing/unnecessary columns
            ☐ add indexes on foreign keys
            ☐ rethink user roles, do we need them? (probably not in the beginning)

        ☐ check postgres connection pool size (see if we can increase it to 10, depending on server cpu and memory)
    
    Caching:
        ☐ redis? (probably not for the beginning since server resources are limited)
        ☐ in-memory storage?
