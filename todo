Api:
    Database:
        Revisit db tables:
            ✔ check core tables for missing/unnecessary columns @done(25-03-15 11:34)
            ✔ add indexes on foreign keys @done(25-03-15 11:34)
            ✔ rethink user roles, do we need them? (probably not in the beginning) @done(25-03-15 10:46)
            ✔ check indexes (single, composite) @done(25-03-15 11:51)
            ☐ create additional indexes if needed (will probably see what else we need once we start implementing the api and frontend)

        ☐ check if postgis is needed or we can create a simple algorithm to determine a list of closest sitters

        ☐ check postgres connection pool size (see if we can increase it to 10, depending on server cpu and memory)
    
    Caching:
        ☐ redis? (probably not for the beginning since server resources are limited)
        ☐ in-memory storage?

    Logging:
        ☐ revisit outgoing log format
Web:
    ☐ maybe look into leaflet.js for map rendering
